A Futuristic Approach for Stroke Rehabilitation Using Smart Gloves

Stroke is a serious, common, and assured as a global health issue across the 
globe. Stroke is one of most common cause of death and is a leading cause of impairment 
in adults. Despite all impressive progression and development in the treatment of stroke, 
without effective modes of care most stroke patients care will continue to rely on 
physiotherapy involvement. The purpose of this paper is to explain about a new and better
device which helps patients affected by stroke who are not able to move their hands. To 
rehabilitate stroke survivors, the proposed prototype is designed such that it is a portable 
smart glove which helps users to regain their muscle memory by continuously contracting 
and releasing their muscles without the involvement of physiotherapist. This device/glove 
also consists of sensors that collect and send data to UI using ESP32. This UI is available 
for the doctors to see the statistics of glove usage and monitors the patientâ€™s conditions. The 
Glove uses a soft robotics approach to replicate the human hand. The Glove initially aims 
to contract and release all the muscles in the hand in regular intervals of time. This muscle 
movement aims to build lost muscle memory.
